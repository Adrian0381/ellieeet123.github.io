        <p>test</p>
        <p>As you can tell, this is a little* bit of a work in progress. At the moment there are four games. This will definently be expanded in the very near future.
        I am also going to make loads of graphic updates to hopefully give a very similar aesthetic to old google sites, which is sadly being fully discontinued on september first.

          <h2>FLASH IS BACK!</h2>
          <br>
          <h5>well... kinda.</h5>
          <br>
          <p>As probably everyone knows, abode discontinued their support for flash player in December 2020, and soon after the extension was removed from most major web browsers.
            However, the other day I stumbled upon a fancy little thing called Ruffle, which is essentially an adobe flash emulator, allowing flash games to be played
            without having to have the official adobe software installed. It is still majorly in development and at this point only supports ActionScript v1.0-2.0, which 
            basically means that it can only run games made in 2007 or earlier, as ActionScript v3.0 (the one that most every other flash game made after that time was made in).
            Ruffle says that they are planning to add support for 3.0 eventually, but it might be a few months until the very first beta release of that. I will keep you
            all updated tho. For now, if anyone knows of any good games to add to the site that work in ActionScript 2.0, please leave them either on the feedback form below!</p>
